You can find the code for slag on Github &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/thehandsomepanther/slag&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; or see the npm module &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/slag-cli&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-problem&quot;&gt;the problem&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up until last year, I was doing all my work on a late 2008 13” Macbook with eight gigs of ram. It wasn’t impossible to get things done, but there were some tasks which took a long time or would start my fan spinning (like launching Illustrator or watching videos on YouTube).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was one thing, though, that absolutely destroyed me every time I opened up my laptop: Slack. I use Slack as my go-to communication app for student groups, which meant that I was liable to be signed into around five Slack teams at any point in time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Slack desktop app is build on Github’s Electron, which in turn uses Chromium on the front-end. Chromium is &lt;a href=&quot;http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/140153/how-to-reduce-chromes-virtual-memory-usage/338111#338111&quot;&gt;pretty&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=393395&quot;&gt;notorious&lt;/a&gt; for being a memory hog, so it’s not hard to see how that could affect desktop applications built on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/slag/activity-monitor.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a screenshot taken on my current work machine, a late 2014 15” Macbook Pro with 16 gigs of ram. At the time this screenshot was taken, I had Slack open for about three minutes. It’s already using up more than a gigabyte of my memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;our-approach&quot;&gt;our approach&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the beginning, the goal of slag was never to replace the Slack app completely–after all, the apps are great. What we wanted was a stripped down version of Slack that was much lighter. Something a user would be able to use on a day-to-day basis for the majority of Slack communications. A client that provided 80% of Slack’s functionality using 20% of the memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This client would ideally provide the essentials of Slack as well as a small subset of the niceties. So while we first set out to implement the larger parts of the Slack app (the messaging, team and channel switching, etc), we also recognized that a lot of the joy of using Slack comes from the little things (emoji, @-mentions, /-commands), and we wanted to recreate those as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, Slack provides a very helpful &lt;a href=&quot;https://api.slack.com/web&quot;&gt;web API&lt;/a&gt; that had almost everything we needed to build out the messaging part. For the ncurses-like terminal GUI, we used a Javascript library called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/chjj/blessed&quot;&gt;blessed&lt;/a&gt;, along with some components from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yaronn/blessed-contrib&quot;&gt;blessed-contrib&lt;/a&gt; and a few custom components as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-few-challenges&quot;&gt;a few challenges&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/-commands like giphy aren’t exposed in Slack’s public web API, but by looking at network calls in a browser we were able to figure them out. @-mentions required some regex expressions to decipher and assemble. Supporting Slack’s colon-flanked &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;:emoji-code:&lt;/code&gt; was a little more of an exercise since Javascript pre-ES6 doesn’t support unicode, but we were able to get it working using surrogate pairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the actual client working, we then worked on improving usability. We put the client on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/slag-cli&quot;&gt;npm&lt;/a&gt; to make it easier to install. Since this was my first npm module, I learned a ton about publishing to npm and writing npm scripts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also realized that adding tokens (i.e. providing credentials) for a team was still a pain. We added some useful commands (namely, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;slag --set-token &amp;lt;token&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;slag --set-tokens &amp;lt;json-file&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;) to make that process easier as well as a helpful manual for new users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-result&quot;&gt;the result&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When all was said and done, we ended up with a Slack terminal client that supported&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;messaging (no points there)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;team switching (still no points, but a gold sticker for trying)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;native notifications when someone @-mentioned you or sent you a DM&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;emoji and Slack’s emoji-code&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;/-commands&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;@-mentions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;marking channels which had unread messages with an asterisk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some things are a little more difficult to implement in a text-based GUI. Among those are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;images/videos&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;links (get printed out, but can run off the screen if they’re too long)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;threads&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also measured our memory usage. This is for a slag client signed into four teams, although results should be comparable across more or fewer team sign-ins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/slag/memory.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;next-steps--retrospective&quot;&gt;next steps &amp;amp; retrospective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re currently working on transpiling slag over from ES6 so it can be used with older versions of Node. If I had the chance to start this project over again, I probably would’ve paid a little more attention to making sure that transpiling would be easier down the road. While we did get to use some nifty ES6 features to handle the asynchronous API calls, it would’ve also been nice to think about accessibility from the get-go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note:&lt;/em&gt; Slack has since made some &lt;a href=&quot;https://slack.engineering/reducing-slacks-memory-footprint-4480fec7e8eb#.79f8z8m33&quot;&gt;improvements&lt;/a&gt; to the client by moving certain teams over to a “minimal client” which a much smaller memory footprint. The full client, however, appears to use the same amount of memory.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">This was a project I worked on with my good buddy Brandon Fujii.

I’m advised by Haoqi Zhang and Nell O’Rourke; my research is funded by an Undergraduate Research Grant from the university.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-problem&quot;&gt;the problem&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior research has demonstrated that &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3102/00346543069001021&quot;&gt;students learn undergraduate science, technology, engineering, and math concepts better&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/JTE/v7n1/gokhale.jte-v7n1.html?ref=Sawos.Org&quot;&gt;when they learn in a collaborative setting&lt;/a&gt;. Despite this, many resources for learning computer science and programming concepts available online put students in an isolated environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collaborative code competitions explores whether we can structure a learning environment which can promote collaborative behaviors among students. Specifically, we are seeking to answer the following research questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Will beginner- to intermediate-level programmers view collaboration in a more positive way if they are made to complete a programming challenge which is by design unable to be completed by a single person?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Is a programmer any more or less likely to view collaboration in a more positive way if she is paired with a programmer whose skill level is greater than, equal to, or less than her own? How do differences in skill level affect the amount of collaboration which happens (i.e. time measured talking)?&lt;/li&gt;

Hackathons, while fun, do require you to essentially give up an entire weekend to work on a project of questionable permanence under borderline inhumane working conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what can we do, as organizers, to convince hackers to come to &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; hackathon, that their sleepless, showerless weekend should be spent at &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; university in &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; student center? This was the question we tried to answer as we developed our branding for the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were two things we knew we wanted our attendees to feel. First, we wanted them to be invested in the hackathon, both in the event itself and in what they were building. We were also aware of another common issue among hackathons, which was that beginners often felt intimidated, and as a result either wouldn’t register for the event or would attend but leave halfway through because they didn’t feel like they could compete. This was something that even a lot of us on the organizing team had experienced, and we knew that inclusion was a large part of cultivating a healthy hacker culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you get hackers invested in something? To answer that we looked at what hackers were already themselves invested in. This turned out to be pretty obvious: hackers, as the name implies, love to hack. They love to create and to watch things come to life. They are makers for their own sake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We wanted to build that sense of investment by providing these hackers with a stake in the event themselves. Our theme, “Build-Your-Own-Hackathon,” was the result. A hackathon put on for hackers, with the hackers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To this end, we put out polls on Facebook asking attendees what they wanted from us for certain parts of the event, letting them decide everything from the kinds of programming we put on to the snacks they ate. We also allowed attendees to submit lightning talks they wanted to give at the event, which hackers then voted on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now what about inclusivity? “Hacking” as a term is often associated with sinister images of men wearing hoodies in dark rooms crouched over a laptop screen, glowing green text scrolling across a terminal screen at a mile a minute. This obviously isn’t an accurate depiction of what goes on at a hackathon, but the fact that it exists means we had our work cut out for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We wanted to subvert this image and create an atmosphere where people of all skill levels could feel like they could come and learn something, if not build a project in 36 hours (aside: this is a topic covered very well and in greater depth by game designer Jenny Hsia in her GDC talk, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1024289/Put-a-Face-on-It&quot;&gt;Put a Face On It: The Aesthetics of Cute&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One idea we came upon was to make characters out of common computer science concepts/various tech-related objects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/wh2016/sketch.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also started working toward a unifying theme, which we stumbled upon during a brainstorming session while we were working on our sponsor packet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/wh2016/sponsorpacket-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s confetti! It was a natural fit, after we thought about it. The confetti made the event seem like a party, a party everyone was invited to. Confetti gave us brevity, excitement, and a versatile visual motif all at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For our type treatment, we chose Avenir Next and Space Mono (we originally went with Fira Code as our monospace, the remnants of which you can see in the sponsor packet). We chose Avenir for its simple, friendly forms and Space Mono as its quirky sidekick, an homage to code, but every bit as fun, if not more, as Avenir.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got to have some fun with the website too. If you visit &lt;a href=&quot;http://wildhacks.org&quot;&gt;wildhacks.org&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll be greeted with a splash page with a nice little animation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/wh2016/site-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also got to make some cool pins starring a few of our computer science characters (an LED and an old-school computer).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/wh2016/pins.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well as some &lt;em&gt;sick&lt;/em&gt; shirts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/wh2016/team.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, I had a blast working with the team to put on WildHacks. Juggling tech, design and directing was a bit hectic at times, but it was definitely all worth it. Beyond here are just a few more pieces of branding ephemera from the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/wh2016/teaser.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A gif we used to tease the launch of the website to build hype. This was released on social media three days before the launch. We had similar gifs for the next two days as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/wh2016/promo.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flyer for an event we held on campus to promote the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/wh2016/compy.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s compy! A winking computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/wh2016/led.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s an LED (this one doesn’t have a fun name, sorry).&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">It’s a bit of an open secret among hackathon attendees that these events are a “sometimes” thing, in the same way that half a sleeves of Oreos is a “sometimes” food.

&lt;p&gt;We investigated how user-centered design teams worked, how they understood Loft and its role, and what we could to do better scaffold their own processes and help them work more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Loft has a lot of parts, since it’s meant to provide structure for the user-centered design process in a supportive, non-intrusive way. A few features include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;an activity feed that lets you see what your team has been working on&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a project plan, which gives team members an at-a-glance understanding of where their project is&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“libraries” for that allow designers to quickly access common “goals” (high-level tasks that a team wants to accomplish, e.g. “user testing”)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;support for holding feedback sessions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our process for research was something like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Determine what our research questions were and form our hypotheses. This usually came from previous work (e.g. we now know that __ happens, could we use __ to help fix that?) or from the software team who were building out features to be tested.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create a testing procedure. This included a list of questions to ask or tasks we would ask users to perform, depending on what we were investigating. This also included information on what data/information to collect and how to do it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Combine our data and synthesize a report.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hand off our findings and start over again.&lt;/li&gt;
