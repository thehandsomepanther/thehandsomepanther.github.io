It wasn’t impossible to do work, but there were some tasks that would take a long time or would start my fan spinning (like launching Illustrator or watching videos on YouTube).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was one thing, though, that absolutely destroyed me every time I opened up my laptop: the Slack app. I use Slack as my go-to communication app for student groups (for good reason, it’s the best one out there), which means that I was liable to be signed into around five Slack teams at any point in time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Slack desktop app is build on Github’s Electron, which in turn uses Chromium on the front-end. Chromium is &lt;a href=&quot;http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/140153/how-to-reduce-chromes-virtual-memory-usage/338111#338111&quot;&gt;pretty&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=393395&quot;&gt;notorious&lt;/a&gt; for being a memory hog, so it’s not hard to see how that could affect desktop applications built on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/slag/activity-monitor.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a screenshot taken on my current work machine, a late 2014 15” Macbook Pro with 16 gigs of ram. At the time this screenshot was taken, I had Slack open for about three minutes. It’s already using up more than a gigabyte of my memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so I enlisted the help of a friend and set out to make a stripped-down version of the Slack desktop app. Our goal was never to try to replace the Slack app completely, but rather to provide a similar experience with a much smaller memory footprint. So while we first set out to implement the larger parts of the Slack app (the messaging, team and channel switching, etc), we also recognized that a lot of the joy of using Slack comes from the little things (emoji, @-mentions, /-commands), and we wanted to recreate those as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, Slack provides a very helpful &lt;a href=&quot;https://api.slack.com/web&quot;&gt;web API&lt;/a&gt; that had almost everything we needed to build out the messaging part. For the ncurses-like terminal GUI, we used a Javascript library called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/chjj/blessed&quot;&gt;blessed&lt;/a&gt;, along with some components from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yaronn/blessed-contrib&quot;&gt;blessed-contrib&lt;/a&gt; and a few custom components as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/-commands like giphy aren’t exposed in Slack’s public web API, but by looking at network calls in a browser we were able to figure them out. @-mentions required some regex expressions to decipher and assemble. Supporting Slack’s colon-flanked &lt;code&gt;:emoji-code:&lt;/code&gt; was a little more of an exercise since Javascript pre-ES6 doesn’t support unicode, but we were able to get it working using surrogate pairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the actual client working, we then worked on improving usability. We put the client on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/slag-cli&quot;&gt;npm&lt;/a&gt; to make it easier to install, but realized that adding tokens (i.e. providing credentials) for a team was still a pain. We added some useful commands to make it easier as well as a helpful manual for new users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When all was said and done, we ended up with a Slack terminal client that supported&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;messaging (no points there)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;team switching (still no points, but a gold sticker for trying)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;native notifications when someone @-mentioned you or sent you a DM&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;emoji and Slack’s emoji-code&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;/-commands&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;@-mentions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;marking channels which had unread messages with an asterisk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also measured our memory usage. This is for a slag client signed into four teams, although results should be comparable across more or fewer team sign-ins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/slag/memory.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note:&lt;/em&gt; Slack has since made some &lt;a href=&quot;https://slack.engineering/reducing-slacks-memory-footprint-4480fec7e8eb#.79f8z8m33&quot;&gt;improvements&lt;/a&gt; to the client.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Up until last year, I was doing all my work on a late 2008 13” Macbook with eight gigs of ram.

&lt;p&gt;So what can we do, as organizers, to convince hackers to come to &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; hackathon, that their sleepless, showerless weekend should be spent at &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; university in &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; student center?
