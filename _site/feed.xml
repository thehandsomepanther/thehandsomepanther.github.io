Her famous essay on self-respect is well-known for good reason. It describes, in much better terms, something which many people have tried (and continue to try) to articulate, to varying degrees of success: that self-respect is, first and foremost, about loving and being comfortable enough with who you are to confront yourself. A lack of self-respect results in what Didion refers to as an “alienation from self:” we concern ourselves so much with the opinions of others that we lose any sense of identity. Without self-respect, we 	have nothing to base ourselves upon and so seek the validation of others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t help but to feel a connection between the thesis in this essay and some of Jean-Paul Sartre’s work, especially his play &lt;em&gt;No Exit&lt;/em&gt; and his idea about the look. There are similar themes about the futility of living for other people and about recognizing your existence as beginning with &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;, the subject, rather than &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;, the object. To respect oneself is to stop justifying your existence to other people and being comfortable with being uncomfortable. It is not easy to achieve, but the discipline and fortitude required is a small price to pay when you consider the alternative.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="writing" /><summary type="html">There’s a lot to learn from this Joan Didion.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And having for years interrogated the stars on the itinerary to follow, the navigator drew the constellations in the night…. 
Having for centuries interrogated the earth, the farmer drew geometric patterns on hills and valleys, transforming them into mosaics…. 
Finally, after examining the omens, the founder of the city drew a geometric perimeter on the ground and thereon he built the city….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these things—constellations, patterns for farms, city limits—are imposed upon the world. They are contrived. They have no right to exist, and they are neither correct or incorrect. These designs are our attempt to make order out of chaos, to control and manage some part of the environment around us. These things make so much sense to us, in fact, that we often forget that they are there. They seem almost as natural as the things they obscure. We look at a globe not remembering that there is no reason why it is placed with North at the top and South at the bottom, or why countries begin and end where they do. The grid, those lines marking latitudes and longitudes, are comforting in their rigidity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the projects in “Mindscapes” almost seem like a caricature of those ideas: order and rigidity and grids blown up to huge scale, something straight out of a science fiction paperback. I’ve come to understand it as a piece of speculative design and a commentary of how unchecked, rampant design (a distinctly human trait) in the end causes us to lose our own humanity. When we look at these landscapes, we see massive, spanning structures which trace a perfect line to a distance focal point. They in many cases (&lt;em&gt;Logging Operation&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Niagara: The Reflected Architecture&lt;/em&gt;) literally dominate the natural world. To us, they stick out and seem unnatural. But will they always? Humans have a remarkable ability to adapt to new environments. Very rarely do we notice all the unnatural buildings and landscapes we live and operate in today. Technology changes rapidly, but we rapidly assimilate it into our lives, adopt it into our work and play.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="writing" /><summary type="html">There’s a quote at the beginning of “Mindscapes” which touches on an idea that’s been echoed in past essays in this series:</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">“This is Not a Cigar: Rereading Rand” by Susan Sellers and Michael Rock</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2018/01/19/this-is-not-a-cigar-rereading-rand-by-susan-sellers-and-michael-rock.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="“This is Not a Cigar: Rereading Rand” by Susan Sellers and Michael Rock" /><published>2018-01-19T01:05:00-06:00</published><updated>2018-01-19T01:05:00-06:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2018/01/19/this-is-not-a-cigar-rereading-rand-by-susan-sellers-and-michael-rock</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2018/01/19/this-is-not-a-cigar-rereading-rand-by-susan-sellers-and-michael-rock.html">&lt;p&gt;It’s not so often that you get see an example of design criticism as lucid and thoughtful as this. This reading of Rand’s work, which begins with an examination of a flyer Rand made for a brand of cigars, shows us just how ripe for examination graphic design can be, despite the fact that it often isn’t subjected to close readings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When reading about design, you often stumble onto people bemoaning the lack of criticism in the field (this was a big topic of conversation during the 90s especially. &lt;em&gt;Looking Closer 2&lt;/em&gt; has quite a number of essays devoted to talking about the various forms criticism might take). Graphic design is often compared to fields like architecture, art, and literature—all fields which involve not only the creation of artifacts but also the commentary on those artifacts by a trained critics. Even today, the question as to why we don’t have a similar culture of discourse around design (usually meaning graphic design in particular), continues to be asked in forums like Jarrett Fuller’s &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scratchingthesurface.fm/post/166768970850/50-one-year-special-with-michael-bierut&quot;&gt;Scratching the Surface&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; podcast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of reasons that have been proposed as to why this lack of critical dialogue around design exists, but that’s left for designers to talk about. For me, a design dilettante, it’s nice to just be able to read an examination into the work of a graphic design icon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This close reading of Rand’s work is a very insightful examination into the graphic devices deployed in order to make things appealing to men. While some have tried to separate design from its cultural context and present the goal of design as being a solution to a problem, design can only be successful if it is done with an intimate knowledge of culture (how people think, what people value) and that designed objects themselves have a tremendous impact on culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This is Not a Cigar” invites us to look at these things which may seem innocuous at first (a flyer, a magazine), but which upon closer examination reveal that design’s foremost role is to materialize various fictions put forth on behalf of (often wealthy, often male, often white) people.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="writing" /><summary type="html">It’s not so often that you get see an example of design criticism as lucid and thoughtful as this.

I’m sure it differs from my understanding of the term, since my experience doing research is very traditionally scientific and academic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But more importantly than the details of how research is done differently in the contexts of design vs. science, research almost seems like the antithesis of design. Research, as I have come to understand it, is about uncovering truths; design seems to be about legitimizing fictions (this idea on how form takes and loses meaning is also covered in previous essays in this series on objects and things). That is, design is the invention of things we take to be true in our culture. It is the source of all contrived truths. This is something I touched on briefly when I referenced Michael Rock’s Bloomberg Businessweek Design 2016 keynote in my last response to Karel Marten’s “What Does Design Mean to Me.” In his talk, Rock mentions design’s incredible power to make things in our world &lt;em&gt;coherent&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Design is a faith-based proposition. For design to work, we have to believe in it. And design is the physical manifestation of fiction, and those fictions are the fictions that we live our life by. So the purpose of design, when we ask, “what is design for?” I would say the purpose of design is to create coherent worlds, that coherence in itself is the function of design. And when you look at coherence, what is coherence? Coherence is to stick together, somehow to make something stick together. So the way we divide the world and make it stick together is the essence of what design does. Another way you could say that is that design projects our desire onto the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This statement really stuck with me when I first heard it. Design is the method through which we impose order on our lives. Design gives things value, meaning, and purpose. Daniel van der Velden echoes a very similar understanding: “Design is added value. En masse, designers throw themselves into desires instead of needs… Design only generates longing. The problem is the problem of luxury” (Jessica Helfand’s &lt;em&gt;Design: The Invention of Desire&lt;/em&gt; explores this idea even further). From this perspective, it becomes obvious as to why design plays such a huge role in commoditization and thus constraining and oppressing people rather than empowering them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;van der Velden also finds that designers themselves are becoming increasingly commodified, and spends a section of his essay on the degradation of the role of the designer as someone whose value comes from their ideas to someone who “holds a mouse and drags objects across a computer screen.” The solution suggested in “Research &amp;amp; Destroy” is for designers to turn to research: the designer needs to be valued for the knowledge they contribute rather than their labor. van der Velden is vague on what research means exactly in this context, but the result of it should be ”knowledge that makes it possible to seriously participate in discussions that are not about design.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s an interesting proposition, but as to whether it would prevent designers from being used for their labor, I’m not so sure. I think the trend van der Velden is describing is extremely relevant today, and I have to say that it’s very apparent that the companies and institutions investing heavily in design today are most likely not hiring designers for their ideas.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="writing" /><summary type="html">I must admit that I’ve never had a good understanding of what designers mean when they use the word “research” (e.g. as the title of Ellen Lupton’s book and former design studio, Design, Writing, Research or in the title of this essay, “Research &amp;amp; Destroy: A Plea for Design as Research).

Here, Martens discusses how he has come to understand the role of design not only as a craft or a profession, but as an extension of himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His take on design is relatively straightforward. Having been brought up in the dogma of Modernism and (at time of writing) now living and designing during a time when those ideals were being so utterly rejected, he draws a middle ground between a completely functional view of design, where the designer’s opinions and beliefs are left out, and a completely expressive view of design, often at the expense of readability: what he refers to as “form about form.” He instead asks for a “form that values content and has respect for the receiver of the message.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s important to keep in mind what was going on in graphic design at the time. Martens wrote this in 1990, in the middle of what would later become know as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.printmag.com/typography/legibility-wars-translation-typography/&quot;&gt;“The Legibility Wars of the ‘80s and ‘90s.”&lt;/a&gt;, a period in graphic design history when new technology and changing attitudes among younger designers resulted in a clash between the old and new guard. Older designers were mostly still rooted in the Modernist, Swiss styles while younger designers were excited to explore everything that new technology made possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1984, Rudy VanderLans started publishing &lt;em&gt;Emigre&lt;/em&gt;, a graphic design magazine which was visually very divisive among designers for its exploration of eclectic type and bold, disruptive typography. Other publications, many founded by young students, started to eschew old rules of readability for the sake of expression. The second installment of the critical graphic design essay series, &lt;em&gt;Looking Closer 2&lt;/em&gt;, was published in 1997 and contains many essays on the subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s clear to see that this essay then is a product of the times, when this sort of debate was a hot topic in the design community. But I think what’s interesting about this is his rejection of content as having some sort of precedence over form. He says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The content of the message has to come over, but the way in which this happens—the melody—is important, not least because in itself it carries communicative value. It is through form that content comes to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a sentiment which has more recently been echoed by Michael Rock in his essay, &lt;a href=&quot;https://2x4.org/ideas/2/fuck-content/&quot;&gt;“Fuck Content”&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2016-06-02/bloomberg-businessweek-design-2016-michael-rock&quot;&gt;opening keynote&lt;/a&gt; to Bloomberg Businessweek Design 2016, in which he advocates for the legitimacy of design in its own right. In Rock’s words, design makes things coherent. Things in the world become real by design—ideas are given form, ideologies given authority, humans given identity. Design is crucial to our understanding of the world and ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="writing" /><summary type="html">Following up yesterday’s statement by designer Weiyi Li, this brief essay comes from one of her teachers at Yale, graphic designer Karel Martens.

&lt;p&gt;Li’s essay discusses some work she’s done to explore the theme of function as narrative, or this idea that “FUNCTION is the projection of human needs on objects… Objects with FUNCTION indicate a possibility of something to happen. FUNCTION leads to a potential story, thus FUNCTION is indeed a narrative.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This, of course, is not a novel concept. Even among the most cookie-cutter design-thinking processes, narrative is stressed as a tool to develop empathy and spot pain points for users, often through the use of things like personas and journey maps. What makes Li’s objects different from products of design thinking process, however, is how &lt;em&gt;personal&lt;/em&gt; they are. The narratives discussed in these projects do not necessarily address a user’s goal or problem but rather explore the relationships between the users and their products. These narratives are deeply personal rather than practical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of her projects is a take on the ring sizer, a piece of plastic with circles of varying sizes cut out to help people find the circumference of their fingers. She takes this idea and creates a new “template,” but instead of many circles intended to measure the same part of her body, she includes many circles, each of which maps to a different part. For example, there is the standard circle for finger size, as well as toes, nipples, tongue, and eyelashes. The template, although it takes a very similar form to the original, now bears a very different narrative. This new object is an exploration in biometrics, and as such becomes almost a form of identification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this project, there’s also a certain role reversal that occurs in the relationship between Li and the template. Originally, the ring sizer, with its standardized units of measurements, was mass-produced and provided to help users conform to a certain system. This gets turned on its head once the template becomes a record rather than a point of comparison. The many to many relation between object and user now becomes one to one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Li’s work in this statement also explore themes of use/misuse and the fluidity of such narratives. She draws on the work of one of her teachers, designer Karel Martens, who used ready-made objects as stamps, and discusses her “ring collection.” This collection comprises objects which were not designed to be rings but could be worn on the finger and considered a ring (i.e. they consist of some time of embellishment or ornament attached to a circular shape which could be worn on a finger).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think there are interesting connections between this and Bill Brown’s “Thing Theory.” Many of the items in this collection are unrecognizable to me, so to me they register as things rather than objects. This means that they not only lose their original identity, but also that they readily accept any new identity which is prescribed to them. Li labels and sells these items as rings, so they become rings only because we do not know them to be anything else. As she describes it, “I was trying to tell a lie one thousand times to make it true.”&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="writing" /><summary type="html">Continuing the discussion that’s been going on with these past few essays on objects is “Function as Narrative,” a statement written by designed Weiyi Li during her time as a MFA student at Yale.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">“Specific Objects” by Donald Judd</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2018/01/11/specific-objects-by-donald-judd.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="“Specific Objects” by Donald Judd" /><published>2018-01-11T22:30:00-06:00</published><updated>2018-01-11T22:30:00-06:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2018/01/11/specific-objects-by-donald-judd</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2018/01/11/specific-objects-by-donald-judd.html">&lt;p&gt;A lot has been said about this particular essay, and for good reason. It serves as Donald Judd’s observations (as I understand it, the text is often misinterpreted as a manifesto for his specific branch of minimalist, Modernist art rather than a description) of the work he has found interesting, these pieces which are “neither painting nor sculpture.” It’s difficult to understand what he means without seeing such a work, so here is an image of one of Judd’s pieces, &lt;em&gt;Untitled&lt;/em&gt;, created four years after the publication of “Specific Objects: “&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i0.wp.com/www.guggenheim.org/wp-content/uploads/1969/01/91.3713_ph_web.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Judd's *Untitled*&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Judd's &lt;em&gt;Untitled&lt;/em&gt;, 1969&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;True to its description, it bears few to no resemblance to painting or sculpture. It shrugs off the hand of the artist, the interpretation of the viewer, the spatiality suggested by a painting’s frame. It sits there, in all three-dimensions, and just commands your attention. As Judd says,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Three dimensions are real space. That gets rid of the problem of illusionism and of literal space, space in and around marks and colors - which is riddance of one of the salient and most objectionable relics of European art. The several limits of painting are no longer present. A work can be as powerful as it can be thought to be. Actual space is intrinsically more powerful and specific than paint on a flat surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think one of the things that really stood out to me about this essay was the lucidity with which Judd speaks about the media on which he and his fellow artists work. It’s very cool to hear a discussion on the limitations of a medium like painting:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Almost all paintings are spatial in one way or another. Yves Klein’s blue paintings are the only ones that are unspatial, and there is little that is nearly unspatial, mainly Stella’s work. It’s possible that not much can be done with both an upright rectangular plane and an absence of space. Anything on a surface has space behind it. Two colors on the same surface almost always lie on different depths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Except for a complete and unvaried field of color or marks, anything spaced in a rectangle and on a plane suggests something in and on something else, something in its surround, which suggests an object or figure in its space, in which these are clearer instances of a similar world - that’s the main purpose of painting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, Judd’s purpose in naming these attributes is to thoroughly subvert them in order to challenge traditional understandings of form and to create new, interesting work. “The disinterest in painting and sculpture is a disinterest in doing it again,” he says, “not in it as it is being done.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of other &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.artuner.com/insight/judd-andre-deshayes-concept-specific-objects/&quot;&gt;pieces&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.guggenheim.org/artwork/1741&quot;&gt;out there&lt;/a&gt; written by people more knowledgable about art history than myself, so I won’t use this post to discuss Judd’s impact on art history. Instead, I think it would be interesting to refer back to another essay I read previously for this series, Bill Brown’s “Thing Theory.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In “Thing Theory,” Brown discusses an idea of how objects that we are familiar with become things. Designers, somewhat obviously, make objects. Any object which is designed to perform a function does so by the will of its creator. When that object breaks down, becomes obsolete, or otherwise is no longer viewed as being able to serve that function, it loses its status as an object and becomes a thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certain things are things to some people and not to others. A child looking at a typewriter may not recognize it or understand it as a tool for writing. To the child, the typewriter is a thing. To an older person who may have used a typewriter in the past, it is still recognized as an object.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s interesting to see then that even though these works being described to us as referred to as “specific objects,” they fall very much in line with Brown’s definition of things. In fact, both essays mention the work of Claes Oldenburg, in reference to his three-dimensional pieces of scaled-up objects, like a clothespin or typewriter eraser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think what makes these specific objects especially powerful, aside from Judd’s point on the power of three-dimensional space, is their immediate status as things. As we view each thing in its entirety, we are immediately confronted with its thing-ness. As opposed to traditional art (e.g. a painting depicting a scene, a statue of a person), where we may first attempt to interpret or understand it, this thing confronts us with its cold indifference and asks us to think about our relationships not only with the object but also with art.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="writing" /><summary type="html">A lot has been said about this particular essay, and for good reason.

They’re often so comfortable that we forget they’re at best approximations. They are, by definition, abstractions over a  a real thing. This is not to say that they’re fragile or unreliable—theories are developed to be resilient, and the process through which theories are formed (i.e. theorizing) is itself rigorous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both theory and theorizing are the topics of Karl Weick’s essay, “What Theory Is &lt;em&gt;Not&lt;/em&gt;, Theorizing &lt;em&gt;Is&lt;/em&gt;,” a response to an essay entitled “What Theory is Not” by Robert Sutton and Barry Staw (all three are researchers in organizational studies). The original essay demarcated a line between papers that contain theory and papers that do not, and named five elements that were often used by authors in place of theory (i.e. references, data, variables, diagrams, and hypotheses). Sutton and Staw bring this issue to light because they describe observing a rash of authors submitting papers with little to no theory simply because journals require strong theory, the effect of which is a weakening of the standards of theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weick’s response to this is not a counterargument but rather a tangential discussion of the act of theorizing, the practice that leads to theory. He describes some of the difficulties that novice theorists might have in identifying which “which of their efforts are theory and which are not. This difficulty arises,” he goes on to say, “because theory work can take a variety of forms, because theory itself is a continuum, and because most verbally expressed theory leaves tacit some key portions of the originating insight.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “originating insight” can consist of any number of activities which led to the development of the theory. And while those activities themselves may not be eligible to be called theories, their existence is necessary for a theory to exist. Whereas a paper without theory may be labeled as having an insufficient contribution, a theory without any rigor or grounding is just as pointless.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="writing" /><summary type="html">Theories are strange things.

You probably have many things literally within arm’s reach at all times—your phone, a wallet, maybe a pair of earbuds. We interact with and use objects every day, some more often than others, some with more ease than others, but always with intention. After all, these objects only make sense in the context of a &lt;em&gt;subject&lt;/em&gt;, usually us, who bestows upon them a purpose. But what happens when this purpose is lost? What about when an object breaks, falls into obsolescence, or is no longer understood? This, and more, is the study of Bill Brown’s essay, “Thing Theory,” in which he provides a way of thinking about the relationships between objects and things as well as our relationships to both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a point of clarification, when Brown talks about “things” here he is meaning exactly what it sounds like: that which we refer to when we say, “hand me that thing over there” or, “what’s that thing you showed me last night?” Things represent that which lies just beyond our grasp. They’re something we know exists and can describe, perhaps even define, but cannot name. As Brown describes it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The word designates the concrete yet ambiguous within the everyday: “Put it by that green thing in the hall.” It functions to overcome the loss of other words or as a place holder for some future specifying operation: “I need that thing you use to get at things between your teeth.” It designates an amorphous characteristic or a frankly irresolvable enigma: “There’s a thing about that poem that I’ll never get.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In understanding the thing then we start to understand our relationships with objects. An object loses its identity and becomes a thing when it no longer fits our model of what that object should be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We begin to confront the thingness of objects when they stop working for us: when the drill breaks, when the car stalls, when the windows get filthy, when their flow within the circuits of production and distribution, consumption and exhibition, has been arrested, however momentarily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus this transition from object to thing becomes less about the thing itself. After all, the thing is still the thing; a broken drill is still made of all the same atoms as a working one, give or take a few. What becomes more clear is our relation to the object. When a drill breaks, it’s no longer a drill to us because it cannot perform the function for which it was named.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are clear connections between these ideas and Modernist design principles. As Louis Sullivan’s maxim goes, “form follows function.” What, then, happens to the form when the function can no longer be fulfilled?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few other Modernists played with the idea of the thing as well. Brown mentions in his essay the work of Surrealists, who frequently removed objects from their comfortable, functional context and turned them into things: Salvador Dali dreamed of a manuscript written in white ink on a brand-new Rolls Royce; André Breton dreamed of finding “a book with a wooden statue of an Assyrian gnome as its spine, and with pages made of black wool” at a flea market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a similar stark awareness of the object that comes from looking at René Magritte’s &lt;em&gt;The Treachery of Images&lt;/em&gt;. The painting, which depicts a pipe and displays the words “Ceci n’est pas une pipe.” (“this is not a pipe”), depicts an object but it is not the object. As Alfred Korzybski said, “the word is not the thing.” I’m also reminded of the work of Giorgio de Chirico, an artist whose work influenced the surrealist movement greatly and revolved around mysterious, ominous scenes. His paintings contained many things, but even the objects you might be able to identify were placed outside their normal context. These objects, now placed in a strange setting with no suggestion as to why it would be there or how it came to be, defy normal understanding and lose any associations with a subject—they can now be understood as things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Chirico's &lt;em&gt;Le mauvais génie d'un roi (The Evil Genius of a King)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking more generally, I think one of the most interesting things Brown mentions is the role that things play in our lives. Since they no longer carry the burden of having to serve a purpose or perform a task, we accept things for what they are—we don’t judge them for their usefulness. There’s a piece called &lt;em&gt;Typewriter Eraser, Scale X&lt;/em&gt;,  a large-scale sculpture of a typewriter eraser by American sculptor Claes Oldenburg that sits in the sculpture garden at the National Gallery of Art. Brown describes the different experiences of people who come across the sculpture:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The pleasure of looking at the people looking at the &lt;em&gt;Typewriter Eraser&lt;/em&gt;, amused by its monumentality, is inseparable from the pleasure of listening to the child who, befuddled by an anachronistic object she never knew, pleads: “What is that thing supposed to be?” What is this disk with the brush sticking out of it? What was a typewriter? How did that form ever function? The plea expresses the power of this particular work to dramatize a generational divide and to stage (to melodramatize, even) the question of obsolescence. While the “timeless” objects in the Oldenburg canon (fans and sinks) have gone limp, this abandoned object attains a new stature precisely because it has no life outside the boundary of art—no life, that is, within our everyday lives. Released from the bond of being equipment, sustained outside the irreversibility of technological history, the object becomes something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Near the beginning, he makes a rather bold assertion about the artist:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;To all appearances, the artist acts like a mediumistic being who, from the labyrinth beyond space and time, seeks his way out to a clearing.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;If we give the attributes of a medium to the artist, we must then deny him the state of consciousness on the esthetic plane about what he is doing or why he is doing it. All his decisions in the artistic execution of the work rest with pure intuition and cannot be translated into a self-analysis, spoken or written, or even thought out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He quotes a line from T.S. Eliot in an essay, “Tradition and the Individual Talent,” where Eliot says, “the more perfect the artist, the more completely separate in him will be the man who suffers and the mind which creates.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this definition of the artist is hard to swallow, that’s because it is. After all, it doesn’t really seem reasonable for a person to create &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; significant without deliberation and intentionality. Following this definition, how could an artist ever produce art? Duchamp recognizes this dissonance and proceeds to talk about what he refers to as the “art coefficient,” the difference between what the author meant to create, what has actually been created, and how the viewer interprets the work (I’ve heard Elliot Earls describe this same concept as “slippage” in one of his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_1qlsIrMnixjorbUg4k3RA/featured&quot;&gt;Studio Practice videos&lt;/a&gt;). Duchamp says the artist is not conscious of this difference. This is where the viewer comes in—the creative act does not end once the artist finishes a piece, but instead extends into the viewing, when a spectator completes the art coefficient (which until now is in its raw state, or &lt;em&gt;à l’état brut&lt;/em&gt;) by interpreting a work. It’s through this process that the spectator judges the piece (i.e. critiques) and transmutes the ideas of the artist into ideas of the viewer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think there’s a lot to unpack in this relatively short essay, but one of the things that I first began to think about was how prevalent the tenants of Modernism played into Duchamp’s ideas. An interesting omission from this essay is any acknowledgement of talent or skill in the creative process (in fact, the thought of an artist developing his or her skill or practicing a certain technique almost seems like it would go against his concept of an artist), and instead insisting that the ideal artist would act without awareness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where Modernism diverges from previous understandings of art art. After all, that’s how art used to be made—if you wanted to paint a tree, you’d have to go out and study the leaves. If you wanted to paint a field, you’d have to go out and learn about perspective to capture the field. Here, however, we start to understand that art is no longer just about representing something tangible, but about being a conduit for the artist’s mind. The mind is the interesting part here, not the trees or the field. Art is a medium for communicating ideas, emotions, or anything else which escapes words. Artists must inexorably find some medium to transfer these ideas through, but it’s still possible to be mindful of the limitations that come from manifesting thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Postscript:&lt;/em&gt; After writing this response it occurred to me that there may be another profession which fits the bill for Duchamp’s ideal “unaware practitioner:” the athlete. In one of my favorite David Foster Wallace essays, “How Tracy Austin Broke My Heart,” DFW contemplates why we so often ridicule athletes for being unable to speak gracefully about their sport, often reciting what we view as clichés or trite, vacuous comments in interviews or in their memoirs. Perhaps, he says, the reason why these athletes speak this way (e.g. “just gotta keep your eye on the ball,” “we just have to play our best and work together”) because to them these phrases are comprehensive (in DFW’s words, “exhaustively descriptive”). These athletes are not only naturals, but they’ve also dedicated so much time to practicing and perfecting these movements that they’ve come to understand them as the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. They don’t think deeply or profoundly about these topics because to them there just isn’t anything to think—they just &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt;. I think this fits perfectly with what Duchamp is searching for: a being who operates in a state of semi-consciousness, their body simply a canvas through which they practice their craft. As DFW states it, “those who receive and act out the gift of athletic genius must, perforce, be blind and dumb about it—and not because blindness and dumbness are the price of the gift, but because they are its essence.”&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="writing" /><summary type="html">Here’s a brief but interesting essay to think about by Marcel Duchamp in which he discusses the role of the artist and the spectator (viewers, critics, historians) in what he describes as “the two poles of creation” in the creative process.
