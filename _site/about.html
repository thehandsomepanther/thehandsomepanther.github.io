    <p>Hi, my name is Josh. I’m a student at Northwestern University, graduating this Spring with a combined BS/MS in computer science. After graduation, I’ll be joining <a href="https://www.figma.com">Figma</a> as a software engineer to work on design tools. Who knows what’ll happen after that.</p>

<p>You may have noticed that the résumé on my home page is not very helpful. To make up for it, I’ve included a list of things I’m doing or have done below. If you’d still like a real copy of my résumé for light reading, please email me at joshshi at u.northwestern.edu.</p>
<ul>
  <li>I conduct research through a course called <a href="http://dtr.northwestern.edu">Design, Technology, and Research</a> and the <a href="http://delta.northwestern.edu">Delta Lab</a>, where I’m advised by <a href="http://eleanorourke.com">Eleanor O’Rourke</a>. My work focuses on on supporting the development of programming problem-solving skills among novice computer science students through collaborative games. I recently submitted <a href="/assets/pyrus-src-paper.pdf">some work</a> that was accepted to <a href="https://chi2018.acm.org">CHI 2018</a>’s student research competition. I wrote about some of the interesting technical challenges of that project <a href="/2018/01/01/pyrus.html">here</a>.</li>
  <li>I’ve been a student fellow at the <a href="https://knightlab.northwestern.edu">Knight Lab</a> for about three years, mostly working on the technical side of projects that operate at the intersection of technology and journalism. My current project involves projection mapped information displays.</li>
  <li>I’m one of two head teaching assistants for a course called <a href="http://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/eecs/courses/descriptions/330.html">Human-Computer Interaction</a>. I previously TA’d for an entrepreneurship course called <a href="http://www.farley.northwestern.edu/we-teach/nuvention/web-and-media.html">NUvention: Web + Media</a>.</li>
  <li>I once directed <a href="https://www.wildhacks.org">WildHacks</a>, Northwestern’s hackathon. I edit(-in-chiefly) the <a href="http://www.thenurj.com">Northwestern Undergraduate Research Journal</a>.</li>
  <li>I’ve worked at Groupon and Box as a software engineer intern. I’ve also done design research work for the <a href="https://loft.io">Loft</a>. I do some freelance front-end work when time permits. I’m currently working with a start-up called <a href="https://www.amper.xyz">Amper</a>. I’m not currently taking new work, but I will be soon.</li>
