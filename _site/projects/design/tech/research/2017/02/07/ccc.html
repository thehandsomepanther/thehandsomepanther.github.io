    <p>This is my current research project for a class called Design, Technology, and Research. I’m advised by Haoqi Zhang and Nell O’Rourke; my research is funded by an Undergraduate Research Grant from the university.</p>

<h2 id="the-problem">the problem</h2>

<p>Prior research has demonstrated that <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3102/00346543069001021">students learn undergraduate science, technology, engineering, and math concepts better</a> <a href="http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/JTE/v7n1/gokhale.jte-v7n1.html?ref=Sawos.Org">when they learn in a collaborative setting</a>. Despite this, many resources for learning computer science and programming concepts available online put students in an isolated environment.</p>

<p>Collaborative code competitions explores whether we can structure a learning environment which can promote collaborative behaviors among students. Specifically, we are seeking to answer the following research questions:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Will beginner- to intermediate-level programmers view collaboration in a more positive way if they are made to complete a programming challenge which is by design unable to be completed by a single person?</li>
  <li>Is a programmer any more or less likely to view collaboration in a more positive way if she is paired with a programmer whose skill level is greater than, equal to, or less than her own? How do differences in skill level affect the amount of collaboration which happens (i.e. time measured talking)?</li>
</ol>
