    <p>Last year, I was part of a team of researchers interested in understanding the experience behind using the <a href="https://loft.io">Loft</a>, an online platform created to help user-centered designers work more quickly and efficiently by scaffolding out the design process.</p>

<p>We investigated how user-centered design teams worked, how they understood Loft and its role, and what we could to do better scaffold their own processes and help them work more efficiently.</p>

<p>The Loft has a lot of parts, since it’s meant to provide structure for the user-centered design process in a supportive, non-intrusive way. A few features include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>an activity feed that lets you see what your team has been working on</li>
  <li>a project plan, which gives team members an at-a-glance understanding of where their project is</li>
  <li>“libraries” for that allow designers to quickly access common “goals” (high-level tasks that a team wants to accomplish, e.g. “user testing”)</li>
  <li>support for holding feedback sessions</li>
</ul>

<p>Our process for research was something like:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Determine what our research questions were and form our hypotheses. This usually came from previous work (e.g. we now know that __ happens, could we use __ to help fix that?) or from the software team who were building out features to be tested.</li>
  <li>Create a testing procedure. This included a list of questions to ask or tasks we would ask users to perform, depending on what we were investigating. This also included information on what data/information to collect and how to do it.</li>
  <li>Combine our data and synthesize a report.</li>
  <li>Hand off our findings and start over again.</li>
</ol>
