    <p>It’s a bit of an open secret among hackathon attendees that these events are a “sometimes” thing, in the same way that half a sleeves of Oreos is a “sometimes” food. Hackathons, while fun, do require you to essentially give up an entire weekend to work on a project of questionable permanence under borderline inhumane working conditions.</p>

<p>So what can we do, as organizers, to convince hackers to come to <em>our</em> hackathon, that their sleepless, showerless weekend should be spent at <em>our</em> university in <em>our</em> student center? This was the question we tried to answer as we developed our branding for the event.</p>
