It's a bit of an open secret among hackathon attendees that these events are a "sometimes" thing, in the same way that half a sleeves of Oreos is a "sometimes" food. Hackathons, while fun, do require you to essentially give up an entire weekend to work on a project of questionable permanence under borderline inhumane working conditions.

So what can we do, as organizers, to convince hackers to come to *our* hackathon, that their sleepless, showerless weekend should be spent at *our* university in *our* student center? This was the question we tried to answer as we developed our branding for the event.
