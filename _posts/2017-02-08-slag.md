Up until last year, I was doing all my work on a late 2008 13" Macbook with eight gigs of ram. It wasn't impossible to do work, but there were some tasks that would take a long time or would start my fan spinning (like launching Illustrator or watching videos on YouTube).

There was one thing, though, that absolutely destroyed me every time I opened up my laptop: the Slack app. I use Slack as my go-to communication app for student groups (for good reason, it's the best one out there), which means that I was liable to be signed into around five Slack teams at any point in time.

The Slack desktop app is build on Github's Electron, which in turn uses Chromium on the front-end. Chromium is [pretty](http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/140153/how-to-reduce-chromes-virtual-memory-usage/338111#338111) [notorious](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=393395) for being a memory hog, so it's not hard to see how that could affect desktop applications built on it.

This is a screenshot taken on my current work machine, a late 2014 15" Macbook Pro with 16 gigs of ram. At the time this screenshot was taken, I had Slack open for about three minutes. It's already using up more than a gigabyte of my memory.

And so I enlisted the help of a friend and set out to make a stripped-down version of the Slack desktop app. Our goal was never to try to replace the Slack app completely, but rather to provide a similar experience with a much smaller memory footprint. So while we first set out to implement the larger parts of the Slack app (the messaging, team and channel switching, etc), we also recognized that a lot of the joy of using Slack comes from the little things (emoji, @-mentions, /-commands), and we wanted to recreate those as well.

Thankfully, Slack provides a very helpful [web API](https://api.slack.com/web) that had almost everything we needed to build out the messaging part. For the ncurses-like terminal GUI, we used a Javascript library called [blessed](https://github.com/chjj/blessed), along with some components from [blessed-contrib](https://github.com/yaronn/blessed-contrib) and a few custom components as well.

/-commands like giphy aren't exposed in Slack's public web API, but by looking at network calls in a browser we were able to figure them out. @-mentions required some regex expressions to decipher and assemble. Supporting Slack's colon-flanked <code>:emoji-code:</code> was a little more of an exercise since Javascript pre-ES6 doesn't support unicode, but we were able to get it working using surrogate pairs.

With the actual client working, we then worked on improving usability. We put the client on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/slag-cli) to make it easier to install, but realized that adding tokens (i.e. providing credentials) for a team was still a pain. We added some useful commands to make it easier as well as a helpful manual for new users.

When all was said and done, we ended up with a Slack terminal client that supported
- messaging (no points there)
- team switching (still no points, but a gold sticker for trying)
- native notifications when someone @-mentioned you or sent you a DM
- emoji and Slack's emoji-code
- /-commands
- @-mentions
- marking channels which had unread messages with an asterisk

We also measured our memory usage. This is for a slag client signed into four teams, although results should be comparable across more or fewer team sign-ins.

*Note:* Slack has since made some [improvements](https://slack.engineering/reducing-slacks-memory-footprint-4480fec7e8eb#.79f8z8m33) to the client.
