This is my current research project for a class called Design, Technology, and Research. I'm advised by Haoqi Zhang and Nell O'Rourke; my research is funded by an Undergraduate Research Grant from the university.

## the problem

Prior research has demonstrated that students learn undergraduate science, technology, engineering, and math concepts better when they learn in a collaborative setting. Despite this, many resources for learning computer science and programming concepts available online put students in an isolated environment.

Collaborative code competitions explores whether we can create a learning environment which
