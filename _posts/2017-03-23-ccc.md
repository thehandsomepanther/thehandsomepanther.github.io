This is my current research project for a class called Design, Technology, and Research. I'm advised by Nell O'Rourke and Haoqi Zhang; my research is funded by an Undergraduate Research Grant from the university.

## The Problem

Prior research has demonstrated that [students learn undergraduate science, technology, engineering, and math concepts better](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3102/00346543069001021) [when they learn in a collaborative setting](http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/JTE/v7n1/gokhale.jte-v7n1.html?ref=Sawos.Org). Despite this, many resources for learning computer science and programming concepts (e.g. Hackerrank, Codecademy, etc.) available online put students in an isolated environment.

Collaborative Code Competitions explores whether we can structure a learning environment which can promote collaborative behaviors among students. Specifically, we test this by scaffolding programming tasks for collaborative behaviors.
