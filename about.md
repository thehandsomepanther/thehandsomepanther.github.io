I'm a junior studying computer science at Northwestern University. I'm interested in using technology, design, and research to make things that help people.

My specific interests include
- human-computer interaction
- interface/interaction design
- design systems
- typography and type design
- editorial design

I'm currently pinned down for this summer, but if you're interested in working with me (regardless of season) or would like a copy of my résumé, feel free to email me at hi at joshshi dot com.
