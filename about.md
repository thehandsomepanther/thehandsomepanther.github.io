Hi, my name is Josh. I'm a student at Northwestern University, graduating this Spring with a combined BS/MS in computer science. After graduation, I'll be joining [Figma](https://www.figma.com) as a software engineer to work on design tools. Who knows what'll happen after that.

You may have noticed that the résumé on my home page is not very helpful. To make up for it, I've included a list of things I'm doing or have done below. If you'd still like a real copy of my résumé for light reading, please email me at joshshi at u.northwestern.edu.
- I conduct research through a course called [Design, Technology, and Research](http://dtr.northwestern.edu) and the [Delta Lab](http://delta.northwestern.edu), where I'm advised by [Eleanor O'Rourke](http://eleanorourke.com). My work focuses on on supporting the development of programming problem-solving skills among novice computer science students through collaborative games. I recently submitted [some work](/assets/pyrus-src-paper.pdf) that was accepted to [CHI 2018](https://chi2018.acm.org)'s student research competition. I wrote about some of the interesting technical challenges of that project [here](/2018/01/01/pyrus.html).
- I've been a student fellow at the [Knight Lab](https://knightlab.northwestern.edu) for about three years, mostly working on the technical side of projects that operate at the intersection of technology and journalism. My current project involves projection mapped information displays.
- I'm one of two head teaching assistants for a course called [Human-Computer Interaction](http://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/eecs/courses/descriptions/330.html). I previously TA'd for an entrepreneurship course called [NUvention: Web + Media](http://www.farley.northwestern.edu/we-teach/nuvention/web-and-media.html).
- I once directed [WildHacks](https://www.wildhacks.org), Northwestern's hackathon. I edit(-in-chiefly) the [Northwestern Undergraduate Research Journal](http://www.thenurj.com).
- I've worked at Groupon and Box as a software engineer intern. I've also done design research work for the [Loft](https://loft.io). I do some freelance front-end work when time permits. I'm currently working with a start-up called [Amper](https://www.amper.xyz). I'm not currently taking new work, but I will be soon.
