My name is Josh and I write software at Figma on the Interface Design team.

In the past I've done freelance and contract software and design work for organizations like [Sanctuary Computer](http://www.sanctuary.computer/), [Amper](https://www.amper.xyz), [FlyHomes](https://www.flyhomes.com), and the Northwestern University Department of Political Science. Not currently taking freelance projects.
