I keep track of the things I read online and want to remember in two places:

- [200 Essays](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TV0BHvKXcsAeVzIfUON7zVkkmC_gkMfu3ufNPSqv6ds/edit?usp=sharing), a spreadsheet of essays. I'm trying to read 200 by the end of this year.
- [reading-list](https://github.com/thehandsomepanther/reading-list/blob/master/reading-list.md), just a straight up list of links.
